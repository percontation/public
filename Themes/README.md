# Themes

Just a couple Mac things for now.

## Polytone Dark ([Textual](http://www.codeux.com/textual/))

A dark theme based off the built-in "Simplified Dark". Improves upon the nickname coloring.

## Twibright ([TextMate 2](https://github.com/textmate/textmate))

I like the way TextMate 2's built-in "Twilight" theme looks on my external monitor (an Apple Thunderbolt),
but it goes all dim on my RetinaBook's screen. Stupid color management. Hence, "Twibright".

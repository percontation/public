# Themes

I like white-on-black and the LCh color space :P

## Polytone Dark ([Textual](http://www.codeux.com/textual/))

A dark theme based off the built-in "Simplified Dark". Improves upon the nickname coloring.

## Twibright ([TextMate 2](https://github.com/textmate/textmate))

A minor modification of TextMate 2's built-in "Twilight" theme to use brighter colors.
